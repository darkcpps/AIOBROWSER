## What is [GreenLuma 2024](https://cs.rin.ru/forum/viewtopic.php?f=29&t=103709)?
GreenLuma 2024 (GL2024) is a Steam unlocker made by Steam006 that is used to obtain games from family shared libraries and DLC for games. There's much more to it, though.

The full list of features provided by Steam006.

## Can I get banned for using GreenLuma 2024?
There will always be a risk when using GL2024. If you're willing to take that risk, go right on ahead. If not, then don't bother. Especially when that risk means the status of your Steam account.

As expected, there are some games that blacklist GL2024 and using it will result in receiving a game ban.  
Some games will check for GreenLuma's files or the manager's files in the Steam folder.  
Some games have server side game and DLC ownership checks.

Please keep in mind. Like CreamAPI, GreenLuma 2024 **does not** work for every game.  
Also, keep in mind that not **every game** is available to play through Steam family sharing.
